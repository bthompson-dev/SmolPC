The AI Assistant for LibreOffice app integrates local AI with LibreOffice Writer and Impress. It allows you to create and edit documents and presentations using a chat interface. You can simply send it a message and it will carry out your request. 

e.g. “Please create me a sales pitch presentation for the new Intel laptops”

The app also offers voice transcription using Whisper, allowing users to interact with the AI without typing. 
All AI models are run locally on-device, so it does not need an internet connection and keeps all data completely secure. It integrates an MCP Server which gives the AI direct access to LibreOffice functionality.
